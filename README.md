📝Products_analysis (Supply_Chain_Dataset)
 
 Here I completed a project using the supply chain dataset. In this project, I created visualizations using Power BI. The main objective for this project is to simplify a large dataset with many rows so that we can
 
 create visualizations that can be easily understood, helping to make decisions that benefit the business.

🎯 Project Overview

  First of all i downloaded the dataset what i want, using kaggle website.

  Dataset link:[supply_chain_data.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20421385/supply_chain_data.csv)

  After downloading the dataset open the datset in the excel file .

  Select the all dataset in the excel using (ctr + A) shortcut.After selecting i insert the table for the dataset in the excel file.

  Identify duplicates using "Conditional Formatting ",then i remove the duplicates and null values.

  After Removing the null values the dataset will be "Consistent State".

  Then i imported the dataset into the SSMS(Sql Server Management Studio).

  Before importing i create one database for Storing the data using SQL query.

  Then write the Queries for Idbetify MIN(),MAX(),AVG(),COUNT(),SUM().

  After writing queries it will be give the output .

  Then i Import the datset to the Power BI desktop(Visualization Tool 📉)

  After importing i transformn the datset i replace the values and transform the alphabets into uppercase letters and removing the null values.

  Then i click close & apply button i started creating visualizations.
